# EDA-CDC-sexually-transmitted-diseases-Dataset

Project Proposal
Description This dataset includes the drug induced death from different states of USA and people with STD cases in the states of USA,I choose this dataset because I need to analyse the condition that people with STD diseases indulge themselves in drugs which can lead them to death.

Hypothesis:
People of california have the highest death count due to drugs use with std cases

Question:
1.) Do people with Gonorrhea cases have the highest number of cases and have the highest mortality rate due to drug overdose in 2010?

2.) Did the deaths increase statewise as the years passed by?

Dataset Links:
1.) Data1 link:https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D140;jsessionid=957FAE5B06A03181B9A9E22DB11B2C97 The data was discovered from data.world with search term drug deaths

Number of Rows:42530

Number of columns:10

Size of Dataset:2.86 MB


Primary Observation:
The primary observation about both the data sets is that the STD dataset is about the std cases of the people from states of USA from year 1996 to 2014 and the drugs dataset about the people death count who were indulged in drugs from states of USA from year 1999 to 2016. By using the two dataset we could analyse the std cases and the drugs death based on the staes and the year from 1999 to 2014.


Hypothesis:
People of california have the highest death count due to drugs use with std cases- Yes


Question:
Did the deaths increase statewise as the years passed by?

Answer :- Yes, as we can observe that the population in the states over the years did not change significantly but the number of deaths in the states grew irrespective of the population.


Do people with Gonorrhea cases have the highest number of cases and have the highest mortality rate due to drug overdose in 2010?

Answer :- No people with Gonorrhea cases do not have the highest number of cases and mortality rate due to drug overdose in 2010 but they have the highest STD cases and drugs death in 2014.
